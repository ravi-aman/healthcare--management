// i have done with all user pages now i we will build hospital page 

// and i am think that hospital should have dashboard for all there work like update or enter available beds , patient registration , enter blood details, pharmacy which are in tabs 


// the dashboard should look like 

// it should have sidebar where at top there would be company logo 



// import { HospitalDashboard } from '@/components/component/hospital-dashboard'
import React from 'react'

function page() {
    return (
        <div>
            {/* <HospitalDashboard /> */}
        </div>
    )
}

export default page
